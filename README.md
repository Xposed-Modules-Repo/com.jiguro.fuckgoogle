## License Verification

### What is Google License Verification?

When using apps from the **Google Play Store**, if your device lacks the Google Services Framework or has an outdated version, apps may display a **Something went wrong** dialog box indicating an issue with the Google Services Framework.

> Something went wrong  
> Check that Google Play is enabled on your device and that you're using an up-to-date version before opening the app. If the problem persists try reinstalling the app.

The app initiates a connection handshake with Google Play's License service to verify whether **Google Play Services** is installed on the user's device. If the connection fails, the above dialog appears and the app force-closes.

Crucially, these apps may not even require the **Google Services Framework** to function properly, making them highly incompatible with de-Googled systems.

This is precisely why this module exists. **FuckGoogleLicense** offers users a temporary workaround to bypass Google's official verification checks.
 
## Getting Started  

### 1. Download  
Select the appropriate release channel from the [Release Channels](#release) and download the latest version compatible with your system environment, or visit the **LSPosed** official page to download.  
If you are a user in a restricted region unable to access the site due to network conditions, please refer to the [Other Issues](#question) section for solutions.

### 2. Installation  
Install the package on your device. Read and agree to the [Software Usage Statement](#statement) beforehand. Then enable the module in the module manager and select the module scope.

<span id="question"></span>

## Other Issues

### Question 1
<font color="red">Why isn't **FuckGoogleLicense** working properly on my device?</font>

**FuckGoogleLicense** is developed by **AIDE Pro** and **Android IDE**. It has been successfully tested on *Android 10 to 15* systems and should theoretically work for most users. However, please ensure your Android version is neither too low nor too high. If **FuckGoogleLicense** still fails to function properly on your device after confirming these conditions, it may not yet be compatible with your device or CPU architecture. Please submit your feedback to us and monitor the **LSPosed** update page or follow channel updates in the [release channels](#release) for the next version update.  

### Question 2
<font color="red">Why does the app still display errors like "Google services not found" after using the **FuckGoogleLicense** ?</font>

Because **FuckGoogleLicense** only bypasses Google's official license detection, we cannot circumvent certain software-specific checks. Even if detection is bypassed, features like Google login will remain inaccessible. Therefore, we state that **FuckGoogleLicense** is merely a temporary workaround.  

### Question 3
<font color="red">Why do certain module functions fail or even cause the scope software to crash when using some non-root frameworks?</font>

This module theoretically supports root-free frameworks. However, on certain devices, the root-free framework's modification patches may conflict with the **FuckGoogleLicense** or the runtime environment of scope-based software, causing crashes or failure. In some cases, these Google-service-enabled applications utilize Google's security hardening, preventing modification of the original installation package. Should this occur, you may switch to an alternative patching method or framework.    

### Question 4
<font color="red">I am a user in a restricted region. What should I do if I encounter access issues?</font>

No worries, we've prepared alternative download links for you. We guarantee that the software and release versions downloaded via these backup links are identical to the original. Additionally, our repositories are available on open-source platforms like Gitee. You can visit the [release channels](#release) to access other download options.
